        Installation
        ============
        
        If you have already downloaded textteaser, run the following
        command inside this directory::
        
            $ python setup.py install
        
        If you have not yet downloaded textteaser, it would be easier to use
        pip::
        
            $ pip install textteaser
        
        or easy_install::
        
            $ easy_install textteaser
        
        Either method will install textteaser into your current environment.

        Development
        ===========
        
        Development for textteaser takes place on bitbucket:
        
        * https://bitbucket.org/jgoettsch/py-textteaser/
        
        A mirror is available on GitHub if you prefer:
        
        * https://github.com/jgoettsch/py-textteaser
        
        To get started you can do the following::
        
            $ hg clone https://bitbucket.org/jgoettsch/py-textteaser/
            $ cd py-textteaser
            $ pip install -r requirements_dev.txt
            $ python setup.py develop
        
        If you discover a bug, please create an issue ticket:
        
        * https://bitbucket.org/jgoettsch/py-textteaser/issues/new
        
        To run the test suite, you will have to create a module at::
        
            textteaser/tests/apikey.py
        
        with a global variable, APIKEY, which is a string containing your API key.
        Then you can run the test suite with nosetests::
        
            $ nosetests --with-coverage --cover-package=textteaser textteaser/tests/tests.py
        
        or through setup.py::
        
            $ python setup.py test
